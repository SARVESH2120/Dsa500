a(refrence variable)(stack) = 10(object)(heap)

--more than one refrence variable point to the same object
--if anyone of these refrence variable cahnege these object then it is going to change for all

--pass by refrence value only java has..


garbage collection- object with have no refrence variable pointing on it, it would remove by the garbage collection



About JAVA

java file have a extension of .java
.java file -> .class file(byte code) -> machine code
JVM to run byte code 
Java (byte code) is independet but JVM is dependent



JDK = JRE + developemt tools
    JRE  = JVM + Library classes
        JVM
            JIT



How JVM works
    -LOading(read .class file)(and obj are created in the heap memory)
    -Linking(allocation of memory to variable and default values are given)
    -Initialzation(statcic varible doesn't depend on the object of the classes)


JIT(makes a execution bit faster)
